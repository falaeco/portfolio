    <h1>Equilibria</h1>
    <h2>December 2019</h2>
    <p>
      Equilibria is a dialogue between an ecosystem in peril and the viewer. As visitors interact with an interactive
      sculpture, they are forced to confront the reality that their consumption ultimately leads to the systemâ€™s destruction.
      This realization prompts viewers to consider how best to conserve the experience for future visitors, who serve
      as a proxy for future generations. Equilibria invites viewers to think about their place within the global
      ecosystem and hopes to develop an awareness of their own finite reality.
